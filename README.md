Assignment: PLTW 2.2.2

Date: 1-26-18

Team Members: Pranav Amuthasenthil, Aakash Balaji, Nikhil Ramesh ... (include first name and last name for each member)

Description:

This assignment was a lesson in ListView, the lesson consists of the various benefits of implementing ListView, including how exactly to use it to a certain program’s advantage and how to successfully use it in conjunction with families, etc. 

Team member roles in assignment: Pranav, Nikhil, and Aakash all had equal roles in the coding and documentation aspects of the assignment. With Aakash talking the lead role of programming and Pranav being the primary source of the documentation.

Key Lessons learned:

The most important teaching points from this lesson consist of pairing the ListView with family, Displaying the Family using the ListView, using and implementing ListView in conjunction with Static variables and the various other benefits and uses that come from utilizing the ListView feature and how exactly this translates to a successful program,.

5) Go to the API for Java and research ArrayList. What methods do you think will be of most use to you?

In our opinion the most important methods were the add() and remove(), since these methods are frequently used to add or remove elements from an arraylist. In our application, using these methods to add and remove family members serves a useful purpose.

27) Test your app. What do you notice? 

The app prompts the the empty activity where other activities can be accessed using the Navigation Drawer. Furthermore, selecting theh "Family Member" tab initializes the Gaurdian activity, where family members can be entered.


Conclusion Questions:


1) Summarize what each of the access modifiers do, and how they are used. (Access modifiers include “public”, “private”, and “protected”)

Access modifiers in general work by limiting the access to who exactly can access the following block of code. The public access modifier works by giving everyone access to the block of code. The private access modifier only gives access to the creator and a few select others access to the block of code. The protected access modifier works by limiting the access of everyone so that only a certain number of others have access to that block of code. These access modifiers also come into play when discussing or using parent and child classes and inheritance of the parents class.

2) Why would you use an ArrayList instead of an array for storing the family?

I would use ArrayList instead of an array for storing the family because of the various necessities and functionalities of the family class would be better suited to be used by an arraylist as opposed to just an array. Since the family class itself is made up of not only familymembers but the various familymembers’s blocks of code it would be very difficult to store the family class using an array. Given the ArrayLists’ additional resources the ArrayList would serve as a much better option for storing the family class.
